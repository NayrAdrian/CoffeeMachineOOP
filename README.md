# CoffeeMachineOOP
An upgraded version of my virtual coffee machine project (OOP)


This is a simple Virtual Coffee Machine project I made using Python. The coffee machine has resources(water, milk, coffee). The coffee machine can make 3 different types of virtual coffee, espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Each has different resources needed and different costs. It also has a "report" function to display the remaining resources and money made by the machine.

The machine only accepts coins specifically quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. The user must insert a sufficient amount or it will not continue and an error message will be displayed. When the required resources are greater than the machine's current resources, an error message will also be displayed.

Features:

Print Report
Check resources sufficient
Turn off the Coffee Machine by entering “ off ” to the prompt
Process Coins, displays change if payment is greater than the cost amount
